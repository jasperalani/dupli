# dupli
Command line duplicate image finder written in Go.

Dupli will find your duplicates, copy them into a folder, and delete the original duplicate.

Dupli only compares png's, jpg's and jpeg's.

Dupli does not compare images with different dimensions

Dupli uses [imgdiff](https://github.com/n7olkachev/imgdiff) to work.

### Usage
`./dupli -scan`<br>
`./dupli -scan -loc=/home/dupli/pictures`

### Todo
- Add soft mode (Copy images that are not duplicates to another folder)
- Create app folder (somewhere) for log storage
